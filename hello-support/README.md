# Hello Support

## Understanding the support system

Thank you patron, we are happy to help. We are here to help you plan, execute and manage. When you start your journey with DNIF, you are likely to have a lot of questions, you might also need help planning your deployment or even be worried about the amount of compute you need for a snappy experience.

Typically our journey with you starts at the solution engineering stage where we understand your requirements \(usually data volumes\) and design a compute structure that you might need to deploy. When you are ready to deploy, you might need installation support, and even support integrating devices. Finally, you might need help managing your setup on an on going basis and you might need maintenance \(or sometimes troubleshooting\) support to keep it going.

The DNIF Support Program has all the options, we provide - 

1. **Community support** - where we provide intense product documentation and a vibrant community that comes together to help you get going.
2. **Standard support** - where DNIF SupportOps team steps in with email support
3. **Enterprise support** - where the DNIF SupportOps team provides phone support
