# Proof of Concept

It always makes sense to try before you buy, specially if you are planning to go dive head first. We plan to support customers and their trials as much as possible, but finally we are limited in many ways. Here are the best models to ensure you have a successful trial.

1. **Train before you try** - it makes sense to get trained or attend a few user group sessions \(or watch some recorded videos\) to familiarise yourself with the workings of the platform.
2. **Start the engagement with a short term subscription model** - try the product with a pre-paid trial, if we aren't able to meet your expectations you can discontinue the contract or if you like what you see you can continue the engagement. You can setup this engagement by [registering for a demo](https://dnif.it).
3. **Engage one of the many partners that support DNIF** - you could directly contact them or connect with them via the DNIF website. Our partners are trained to provide support for planning, deployment, threat modelling, implementations and other professional services.

## Raising a support ticket

If you have downloaded the free version of DNIF and are trying it in isolation, you will not be able to raise a support ticket. In this case the best place to get help is the [community forum](https://stack.dnif.it) or the online [documentation](https://dnif.it/docs). However if you have signed up with DNIF \(via a [demo](https://dnif.it)\) for a pre-paid \(subscription\) Proof-of-Concept you will get supported under the standard plan and will be able to raise a ticket by writing in to the support email address.
