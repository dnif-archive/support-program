# Not covered under support

Here are some asks that the DNIF SupportOps may not be able to fulfill

* Validating/ troubleshooting a DQL query or entity
* Backing up or pruning old indexes
* Be responsible for monitoring disk space
* Handling threats detected by DNIF
* Building custom entities in a package
* Coming over \(onSite\) to install DNIF
* Configuring devices to send events to DNIF
* Configuring DNIF to detect attacks
* Setting up available connectors/ parsers
* Writing process of integrating a specific device

{% hint style="info" %}
Integration procedures for devices are available on a best effort basis, there may be times when SupportOps may provide remote support to integrate undocumented devices, but this however is only on a best effort basis.
{% endhint %}
