# Remote Support

Some situations demand hands on troubleshooting or support to achieve a quick resolution. In these conditions the SupportOps can request a remote support session from the customer/ partner for quick and effective troubleshooting and resolution of the issue.

Process flow for providing remote support on an issue.

1. Customer reports an issue and a ticket is opened
2. Initial issue is investigated by the SupportOps over email
3. If the issue isn't resolved or needs further investigation the ticket owner requests a remote session with the customer/ partner
4. The customer/ partner selects a slot from the provided options
5. Meeting details and dial-in numbers are shared with the teams
6. Investigation is performed on the remote session, and diagnostic details recorded
7. If the issue is resolved, a ticket update and a resolution guide is shared
8. If the issue is not resolved then alternate strategies/ workarounds are suggested and a new remote session is requested

##  Notes

* The customer/ partner is required to continuously be a part of the remote session and all investigative details will be shared with the representative while the analysis is performed.
* A remote session will always require the customer/ partner to be available on the voice call so decisions can be taken and on-site support can be provided.
* Decisions of initiating a remote support session solely lies on the DNIF SupportOps team.
* DNIF SupportOps may request some pre-requisites to be performed or data to be collected and sent to better plan an effective troubleshooting session.

{% hint style="info" %}
All remote sessions initiated by the SupportOps team will be carried out using [https://zoom.us](https://zoom.us/) we discourage remote support applications that do not work on linux.
