# Calling In

Calling in for support is arguably the fastest way of resolving issues, however there are some challenges a major one being the ability to evaluate the best solution while solving issues on the fly. Therefore here are some recommendations for Calling In support.

* New tickets/ issues can only be reported over email
* Every calling in support request must have a running ticket ID
* Direct calling in support is only available on **Priority 1** tickets
* Calling in support requests can only be taken by the handling engineer
* Priority 2/ 3/ 4 tickets can only expect an instant telephonic response from the handling engineer if \(a\) the engineer is available \(b\) the engineer has an update to provide
